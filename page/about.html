            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
              Hi, I’m Laura, a 27-year-old French islander at heart, creative
              thinker, and movement enthusiast.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was born in France but raised in New Caledonia, where I grew up
              surrounded by turquoise water, palm trees, and a strong sense of
              curiosity about the world. At 18, my curiosity led me to
              Singapore, where I studied illustration and concept art. That
              adventure eventually brought me to Wellington, New Zealand, where
              I studied graphic design at Yoobee Colleges before completing a
              Bachelor in Media Design at Victoria University of Wellington.
            </p>

            <h2>My Creative Journey</h2>
            <p>
              My career has always been about blending creativity with
              problem-solving. I started out as a web designer and Webflow
              developer at Psychoactive Studios, where I worked for three years
              helping brands bring their digital ideas to life. Today, I’m a
              Creative Developer at KISSLabs, a boutique design studio with a
              drive to “Keep it simple stupid,” making digital design both
              beautiful and simple.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond design, I also studied health coaching and earned two
              diplomas in personal training, because health and movement are
              just as much a part of my life as design. For me, creativity flows
              best when the body and mind are both well taken care of.
            </p>

            <h2>Movement, Growth and Energy</h2>
            <p>
              I’m slightly hyperactive and almost always on the move. Whether
              I’m walking to work, running around my suburb, lifting weights at
              the gym, or training for my next challenge, movement is my reset
              button. I once ran a half marathon and decided long-distance
              running wasn’t my thing. Now, I’m training for a HYROX
              competition, which is a mix of strength, endurance, and grit that
              feels much more my style.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve also been diving into fascia-focused training and deep core
              work to help balance out my hypermobility and scoliosis. My
              workouts aren’t just about performance, they’re also about
              resilience, rehab, and reconnecting to my body.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Love</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Books:</strong> I’m a huge reader and love self-help,
                psychology, fiction, science, and holistic health.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Food:</strong> I love cooking everything from scratch.
                Right now, my big obsession is fermentation, with kombucha and
                kimchi experiments always bubbling in my kitchen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Creativity:</strong> From illustration to design, I’m
                passionate about creative expression. Recently, I’ve taken up
                knitting as a way to occupy my hands, and it’s an incredible
                stress reliever. Research suggests hands-on crafts can support
                neuroplasticity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Video Games:</strong> Games are another big passion of
                mine. My favorites include the Borderlands series, Divinity:
                Original Sin and Original Sin 2, and storytelling games like
                Firewatch and Life is Strange. I also love puzzle-rich worlds
                like Gris and The Witness. I’ve had long obsessions with Dota 2,
                World of Warcraft, and survival games such as Minecraft, Conan
                Exiles, Subnautica, Terraria, and ARK. These days, my obsession
                is shifting into the world of Magic: The Gathering.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learning:</strong> I tend to start a new course every
                year. Whether it’s a creative skill, a health certification, or
                a new perspective on life, learning keeps me sharp and inspired.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Life Between Languages and Cultures</h2>
            <p>
              French is my mother tongue, but I’ve been speaking English for
              over a decade. Living across different countries and cultures has
              shaped me into someone who adapts easily, stays curious, and
              values both growth and connection.
            </p>

            <p>
              I see myself as a blend of creative developer, health nerd, and
              lifelong learner. I’m driven by curiosity, grounded by movement,
              and inspired by the idea of building things, whether that’s a
              website, a training plan, or a fermented recipe in my kitchen.
