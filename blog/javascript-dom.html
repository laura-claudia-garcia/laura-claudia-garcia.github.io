            The DOM and how it connects HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          </h1>
          <p>
            Websites are created with three key building blocks: HTML, CSS and
            Javascript. Those 3 languages have different roles and can interact
            with each other. Let’s compare it to building a house.
          </p>

          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language we use to create
            the base structure of a website, aka the foundations and walls of
            your house. Without the foundations, your house wouldn’t work. With
            just the foundations, your house would be able to stand and do its
            basic job, but it would look pretty boring. That’s where CSS comes
            in!
          </p>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>
            CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) is the coding language used to style the
            HTML content, aka to make your house look pretty with paint,
            furniture, and decorations! With CSS, you can target HTML elements
            as well as classes and ids to change their visual appearance such as
            the background colour, font colour, font size, position etc. You can
            also add some very basic interactions (mousehover, focussed etc),
            but nothing too complicated or exciting. Well, that’s where
            Javascript comes in!
          </p>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is a coding language used to add functionality to HTML.
            This would be the electricity and plumbing which brings your house
            to life. But Javascript doesn’t directly change HTML, it needs the
            DOM to be able to interact with HTML content. But what’s the DOM you
            ask?
          </p>

          <h2>The DOM</h2>
          <p>
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is not a programming language, it is
            the representation of structures and content of web documents. It
            could be seen as the map for your house, with the name of every
            element in the house, that javascript can use to access, read,
            write, modify and create HTML elements. Javascript does all of these
            actions through methods, properties and events. This can be done
            inline with <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements in the HTML file or
            with a separate javascript file that is then linked in the HTML
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. <br />
            <br />
            Elements can be selected with Javascript via their class, ID, HTML
            tag name or CSS selectors.
          </p>

          <img src="../assets/img/dom-visual.png" />
          <p>For Example:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;h1 class="blogHeader"&gt;My Old Title&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
document.querySelector(".blogHeader").innerHTML = "My New Title";
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

          <p>
            This code tells the Javascript to find the heading with the class
            <code>blogHeader</code> in the DOM, and replace its text.
          </p>

          <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
          <p>
            Now let’s have a look at ways to group data. Both arrays and objects
            are used to store groups of data, but they are organised
            differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            An array is an ordered collection of values, like a shopping list,
            except we start counting from 0 instead of 1. You access the value
            with their position in the list. The values can be of any type
            (number, string, boolean, arrays, objects). Values can be added,
            removed and updated in an array with different methods. The number
            of values in an array can be checked with the
            <code>.length</code> method.
          </p>

          <pre><code>// Our shopping list would be written like such:
let shoppingList = ["banana", "apple", "cucumber", "hummus"];

// Access the first value of the array:
console.log(shoppingList[0]); // banana

// Check the number of items in the shopping list:
console.log(shoppingList.length); // 4
</code></pre>

          <p>
            An object is also a collection of values but each item has a key and
            a value, similarly to a dictionary. The key is the identifier, and
            the value is the data stored. Contrary to arrays, you access the
            object data by calling a key. Just like an array, an object can be
            added, modified or removed.
          </p>

          <pre><code>// Let’s image we have a medical file about someone:
const patientOne = {
  name: "Laura",
  age: 27,
  allergies: ["cats", "dogs", "pollen"],
  address: { 
    street: "33 Cuba street", 
    neighborhood: "Te Aro", 
    city: "Wellington"
  }
};

// check the name of patient one:
console.log(patientOne.name); 
</code></pre>

          <h2>Control Flow</h2>
          <p>
            Control flow is the order in which the code is happening. Javascript
            executes its code from top to bottom by default, similar to a
            recipe. But sometimes you might need to modify the flow to make
            decisions, repeat actions, and jump to other parts of the code based
            on set criteria. That’s where conditional statements, loops and
            functions come in.
          </p>

          <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
          <p>Conditional statements execute when a condition is met.</p>
          <p>
            Let’s take doing the laundry as an example. The clothes can either
            be dry or not. If the clothes are dry, then I will put them away,
            otherwise I will let them dry.
          </p>
          <p>In javascript it would be translated to an if statement:</p>

          <pre><code>let clothesDry = false;

if (clothesDry) {
  console.log("Fold and put them away!");
} else {
  console.log("Hang them back up to dry.");
}
</code></pre>

          <h3>Loops</h3>
          <p>
            Loops repeat a block of code until a condition is no longer met.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s take washing the dishes as an example. There are a few dirty
            things such as pots and pans, that we will group together as the
            “dishes”. I need to keep doing the dishes until the last item is
            clean.
          </p>
          <p>In javascript this would translate to:</p>

          <pre><code>// group the dishes into an array:
let dirtyDishes = ["pot", "pan", "plate", "cutlery", "glass"];

// go through the dishes one by one until there are no more dishes:
for (let i = 0; i &lt; dirtyDishes.length; i++) {
  console.log(dirtyDishes[i] + " is clean!");
}
</code></pre>

          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions are reusable blocks of code, similar to a reusable recipe.
            They are extremely helpful to avoid repeating yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we take our previous example of doing the dishes, we could turn
            it into a repeatable action (function) that we can reuse whenever
            there are dishes to do.
          </p>

          <pre><code>// create the function:
function cleanDishes(dishes) {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; dishes.length; i++) {
    console.log(dishes[i] + " is clean!");
  }
}

// group of dirty dishes:
let dirtyDishes = ["pot", "pan", "plate"];

// clean the dirty dishes:
cleanDishes(dirtyDishes);
</code></pre>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            HTML is used to build the skeleton, CSS dresses it up, JavaScript
            makes it functional, and the DOM is the translator that lets
            javascript communicate with HTML.
