          <h2>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I can struggle to realise that sometimes I know things that other
            people don’t, and that those things aren’t just “basic knowledge”.
          </p>
          <p>
            I struggle to bond with other people in an online environment: I
            haven’t really been feeling comfortable engaging more with people in
            my course for the moment. Whereas in other in-person courses I have
            done in the past, after 2 months of studying, I would have formed
            friendships and acquaintances.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would rather do it alone than ask for help due to the online and
            after hours format of the course: I usually work after my job in the
            evening while having dinner, and being an introvert, I have usually
            ran out of social battery by the time I open my computer to study,
            this means that I can struggle to want to connect with peers and
            tutors when needing help, and would rather find other ways that
            don’t involve interacting with a person I don’t know well.
          </p>

          <h2>
            What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
            learning and programming?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Developing self-awareness and emotional intelligence is crucial in
            programming and learning. The ability to know yourself will help
            customize your learning plan so it works for you and uses your
            skills and learning modes more efficiently, while avoiding stress
            and intense negative emotions. But it also helps to understand and
            work on your weaknesses and triggers to be a better person to work
            with. Being able to work with others is a big part of programming.
            Efficient collaboration includes the ability to empathise with
            others, communicate well and resolve conflict in a positive way.
          </p>

          <h2>What has surprised you the most about Human Skills learning?</h2>
          <p>
            How intimate the questions were: I wasn’t super comfortable sharing
            such deep thoughts publicly on the internet and with people I have
            never met before in person. The lack of human contact in the
            online-course makes this experience very uncomfortable for more
            introverted people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subject focus: I knew there was a human skills part of this course
            but I didn’t know we would be putting such emphasis on it. It feels
            a bit out of balance compared to the tech skills we’re learning. In
            a development course, I was hoping we would be focusing more on the
            coding aspect of things, with human skills being a bonus. If people
            need to become better humans, they should do so in a special course
            in my opinion.
          </p>

          <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of Human Skills learning?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Self-reflections and research: since I struggled to see the point of
            certain subjects, I really struggled to motivate myself to look
            deeper into certain subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing blogs: since english is my second language, I found writing
            long articles quite challenging, but I liked the opportunity to
            develop this skill.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Helping people become better humans and easier people to work with
            will help them be more employable. In a world where most people have
            the ability to learn coding, what really sets someone apart can be
            their ability to communicate, work with other people and resolve
            conflict in a positive way thanks to a higher degree of emotional
            intelligence.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I did a little bit because I already have studied most of these
            subjects in previous courses I have undertaken as a Health and
            Exercise coach.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
            Justify your answer.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I find it is good to set a base of how people are meant to be
            working together in the bootcamp, but I do think the emphasis on
            human skills was a bit too heavy in my opinion. I would have liked
            to do a bit more coding, a bit less writing about human skills.
