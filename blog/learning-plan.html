          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            I would like to be a fullstack developer in the next 4 to 5 years to
            progress my career. I started my career as a graphic designer in my
            20s. This led me to become a web designer and webflow developer. My
            background in graphic design provided me with a strong eye for
            detail, user experience and aesthetically driven solutions which can
            be especially useful to develop software products.
          </p>
          <h2>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am a curious and hard-working perfectionist, with a deep passion
            for design and continued-growth. I try to keep growing and learning
            more about things that I love to grow in the areas that bring me joy
            and fulfillment, but I sometimes struggle to know when to stop/when
            something is “good enough”. I am very industrious, which means that
            I also tend to get annoyed when people working with me seem to be
            doing less or care less about a project. I am quite self-disciplined
            and organised which makes it easier for me to keep track of project
            progress and meet deadlines.<br />
            As an example, in sprint 1-2 I had no issue sticking with my
            learning plan (studying a little every day and aiming to publish
            content to github everyday) but I struggled to not go over the
            timebox for project-based lessons (e.g. blog styling). <br />
            I am currently actively working on sticking to timeboxes (by
            time-tracking with Toggl) in order to not let my perfectionism get
            the best of me.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am looking forward to working in collaboration with other
            classmates in the bootcamp. I tend to have issues working in teams
            when people don’t communicate or say what they said they’ll do. I
            would like to be better at working through obstacles in a positive
            and productive way without getting emotional.<br />
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself
            to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators
            and industry/community representatives; What you will do when things
            are building up and starting to get to you.<br />
            I will ensure that I work productively by studying every evening and
            a little more during weekends. This ensures that I progress and
            practice new learnings everyday and stay on track with sprint
            timelines. <br />
            I will make sure that I take a break when I need one and ask help
            when I am stuck to avoid overworking myself. <br />
            I will stay on top of communication with classmates and facilitators
            and respond to messages and announcements in a timely manner (within
            12 to 24 hours). I will also foster a safe and inclusive community
            by making sure I am being respectful of other people’s beliefs and
            emotions.<br />
            If I ever feel stressed, overwhelmed or behind, I will get in touch
            with a facilitator to put a plan together in order to work through
            challenges without falling too far behind and avoid affecting other
            people’s learning experience.
          </p>
          <h2>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I will reach out for help via discord to my peers and facilitator if
            I get stuck for more than 1 to 2 hours in order to get unstuck or
            look at my problem in a different perspective.
          </p>
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
          <p>
            I am expecting my facilitators to help me get unstuck without giving
            me solutions, but rather by helping direct me towards ways I haven’t
            thought about, except if I am really lost and frustrated and might
            need a little more technical help. I would also expect a facilitator
            to provide recommendations when I am unsure of what tools, libraries
            or tech stack to use for a specific outcome.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am planning on taking a two week break in September, and I will be
            going on a trip to Asia in December, but these are all within the
            course’s holiday breaks.
