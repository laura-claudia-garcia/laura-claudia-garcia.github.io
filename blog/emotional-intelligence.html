            Emotional Intelligence
          </h1>
          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) is the capacity of
            someone to understand and manage their own emotions, empathise with
            others and build strong relationships. EQ is an important factor to
            achieve successful careers, relationships, including and especially
            the relationship with ourselves, and the good news is that it can be
            learnt.
          </p>
          <h2>How to learn EQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Learning EQ can be broken down in 4 categories or levels: stress
            management, self-management, self-awareness, social awareness, and
            relationship management.
          </p>
          <h3>Stress Management</h3>
          <p>
            Learning to manage stress is the most important step to achieving
            EQ. When people are overly stressed, they get overwhelmed and tend
            to lose their capacity to control themselves. Stress management
            helps us learn to stay emotionally present without letting stress
            override our thoughts and self-control.<br />
            <br />
            Sadly, nowadays most people experience stress on a daily basis and
            don’t realise the negative impact it can have on their mental,
            physical and relational health. Chronic stress is linked to high
            blood pressure, low immunity, high blood sugar, anxiety, depression
            and faster ageing to name a few.<br />
            <br />
            Here are a few activities to manage and reduce stress levels:
            breathing exercises, journaling, learning to say no, practicing
            gratitude, making time for social connection and fun, movement, and
            practicing a healthy lifestyle (sleeping enough, avoiding caffeine,
            alcohol, cigarettes, prioritising a whole food diet, drinking enough
            water).<br />
            <br />
            It is important to learn to manage stress to feel more comfortable
            confronting stronger and unpleasant emotions.
          </p>
          <h3>Self management and self awareness</h3>
          <p>
            The first step to self awareness is to learn to identify our
            emotions and behaviour to then be able to manage them in a
            healthy/positive way. To control impulsive feelings and behaviours,
            we first need to know they exist, and this can be done by first
            paying attention to our internal world.<br />
            <br />
            Useful tools to identify and reconnect to our emotions are
            mindfulness and journaling. Practicing mindfulness is done through
            the practice of full presence, without negative judgment, sensing
            the physical effect of a said emotion (facial expression or bodily
            sensations), and analysing our reaction to them. Do you feel it in
            your chest or in your abdomen? Is there a train of thoughts that
            comes back when you feel a certain emotion? Do you tend to react the
            same way to a certain trigger? How strong is the emotion?<br />
            <br />
            Then we can use this information to make decisions about our
            reactions and behaviours. This is an amazing tool to adapt to the
            changing circumstances of our fast moving world.
          </p>
          <h3>Social Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Social awareness allows you to identify and interpret the verbal and
            non verbal of others. To build social awareness you need to practice
            mindfulness, be in full presence to better pick up on both verbal
            and non verbal cues.
          </p>
          <h3>Relationship management</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional and social awareness are required to develop and maintain
            great relationships. In order to maintain good relationships, you
            have to be able to be aware of and manage your emotions and
            behaviours, communicate effectively, be able to manage and defuse
            conflict. A great mindset shift is instead of being afraid of
            conflict, seeing it as an opportunity for growth.
          </p>
          <h2>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Intellectual ability or Intelligence quotient (IQ) is the capacity
            of someone to perform logic reasoning, problem-solving and
            analytical skills. It can be measured with IQ tests. But a high IQ
            doesn’t mean that someone will be more successful or have a higher
            quality of life, especially if they have a low EQ. Someone with a
            high IQ that has a poor ability to manage their stress for tests and
            exams, is likely not going to perform well.
