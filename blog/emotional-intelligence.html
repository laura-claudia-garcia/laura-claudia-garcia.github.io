            Emotional Intelligence
          </h1>
          <p>
            Have you ever met someone who was academically brilliant but
            extremely hard to work with? The missing ingredient could possibly
            have been Emotional Intelligence. But what exactly is it? <br />
            <br />
            Emotional intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) is the capacity of
            someone to understand and manage their own emotions, empathise with
            others and build strong relationships. EQ is a key factor in
            achieving successful careers, building meaningful relationships, and
            fostering a healthy relationship with ourselves. The good news is EQ
            can be learned through self-exploration and practice.
          </p>
          <h2>How to learn EQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Learning EQ can be approached by progressing through four
            categories: self-management, self-awareness, social awareness, and
            relationship management.
          </p>
          <h3>Self Management</h3>
          <p>
            Learning to manage stress is the most important step to develop EQ.
            When we are overly stressed, we can become overwhelmed and lose our
            capacity to control ourselves. Stress management helps us stay
            emotionally present and maintain clear thinking under pressure.<br />
            <br />
            Sadly, most people experience stress daily and don’t realise the
            negative impact it has on mental, physical and relational health.
            Chronic stress is linked to high blood pressure, low immunity, high
            blood sugar, anxiety, depression and faster ageing to name a few.<br />
            <br />
            To achieve greater balance, you can experiment with techniques such
            as breathing exercises, journaling, learning to say no, practicing
            gratitude, making time for social connection and fun, movement, and
            practicing a healthy lifestyle (getting enough sleep, avoiding
            caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, prioritising a whole food diet,
            drinking enough water).<br />
            <br />
            It is important to learn to manage stress to feel more comfortable
            confronting stronger and unpleasant emotions.
          </p>
          <h3>Self awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Self awareness begins by learning to identify our emotions and
            behaviours so we can manage them in a positive way. To control
            impulsive feelings and behaviours, we first need to notice they
            arise, which starts paying attention to our internal world.<br />
            <br />
            Useful tools to identify and reconnect to our emotions are
            mindfulness and journaling. Practicing mindfulness is done through
            the practice of full presence, without negative judgment, sensing
            the physical effect of a said emotion (facial expression or bodily
            sensations), and analysing our reaction to them. Do you feel it in
            your chest or in your abdomen? Is there a train of thoughts that
            comes back when you feel a certain emotion? Do you tend to react the
            same way to a certain trigger? How strong is the emotion?<br />
            <br />
            This awareness will help us make conscient decisions about our
            responses. This is an amazing tool to adapt to the ever changing
            circumstances of our fast moving world.
          </p>
          <h3>Social Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Social awareness allows you to identify and interpret the verbal and
            non-verbal of others. To build social awareness you need to practice
            mindfulness, be in full presence to better pick up on both verbal
            and non-verbal cues.<br />
            <br />
            A great way to increase social awareness is to practice active
            listening. Giving someone your entire attention, maintaining eye
            contact, Being fully present, and avoiding interrupting.<br />
            <br />
            Don't be scared to role play with trusted people to practice and get
            feedback to assist your learning. This can be especially useful when
            preparing for tough conversations.
          </p>
          <h3>Relationship management</h3>
          <p>
            Strong relationships are built with emotional and social awareness.
            To maintain them, we need to be aware of and manage our emotions and
            behaviours, communicate effectively, manage and defuse conflict
            constructively. Instead of being afraid of conflict, we should see
            it as an opportunity for growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            Feedback is important both for personal and career growth. You can
            practice your relationship management by practicing giving
            constructive feedback using the ASK framework (Actionable, Specific,
            Kind).<br />
            <br />
            When a conflict arises, aim to use "I" statements instead of the
            acusing "you". For example: “I felt concerned when the deadline was
            missed because it impacts the whole team,” rather than “You never
            meet deadlines.”<br />
            <br />
            Celebrating other people's success both big and small will help
            strength trust and connection in a team. Congratulating a colleague
            for a contribution to a project goes a long way.
          </p>
          <h2>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h2>
          <p>
            Intellectual ability or Intelligence quotient (IQ) is the capacity
            of someone to perform logic reasoning, problem-solving and
            analytical skills. It can be measured with IQ tests. But a high IQ
            doesn’t mean that someone will be more successful or have a higher
            quality of life, especially if they have a low EQ. Someone with a
            high IQ that has a poor ability to manage their stress for tests and
            exams, is likely not going to perform well.
          </p>
          <h2>In summary</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is a must have to be able to work efficiently
            and positively with others. It is a skill that can be developed
            through mindfulness, self-discovery and ongoing practice. And the
            bonus is, developing our EQ will no only benefit our social
            relationships but also our own wellbeing and success.
