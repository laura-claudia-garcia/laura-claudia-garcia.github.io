            Two years ago, I was made redundant from a company I had worked at
            for three years. The entire team was made redundant for the business
            to transition to a freelancer model to reduce cost in a period of
            financial instability. This made sense from the company point of
            view, but the process did not comply with New Zealand’s employment
            laws, and my colleagues and I were put under extreme stress, we all
            felt unsupported and betrayed.<br />
            <br />
            A colleague of mine decided to take legal actions against the
            company and invited all of us to join him. After doing some research
            on the legal implications and reflecting on my values, I decided not
            to join him. I felt betrayed and angry from the way we were being
            let go off, I wanted justice and to support my colleagues, but I
            also felt deep gratitude and loyalty towards my boss, who had been
            my mentor and friend. He had taught me everything I knew and
            kickstarted my career in an incredible manner, and was offering to
            keep working with him as a freelancer. I knew that preserving that
            relationship could allow me to continue working with the company.
            Taking legal actions would have shown support towards my colleagues
            but it would not have provided me with any positive outcomes, other
            than potentially some money. This was a moral dilemma because I had
            to choose between deep values: seeking fairness or maintaining a
            professional relationship which could potentially support my future.
            Looking back, I believe I have taken the right decision because I am
            still very good friends with all of my former colleagues, and I
            still freelance with my former boss, who deeply trusts me. This
            experience taught me that ethical decisions involve trade-offs, and
            that integrity can mean different things depending on what values
            you choose to prioritise.

            My father has always taught my sister and I the values of hard work,
            passion, independence, community and communication. He often worked
            long hours but taught us that sometimes it was necessary in order to
            reach your goals, especially when you are passionate about what you
            do. His deep passion for his work made it easier to work long days.
            He believed that independence was important so he would encourage us
            to try to solve things on our own before offering his help.
            Community and connection were very important to him. Family and
            friends were always welcome in our home at any time of the day and
            night. He would organise big family gatherings whenever possible.
            One of his guiding principles and life work was based on good
            communication. He believed that communication can solve almost
            anything, being hard on the problem and easy on the person. My dad’s
            values greatly shaped the way I approach work and challenges today:
            I work very hard for what I am passionate about, but I am not afraid
            to ask for help after trying on my own, I deeply care for friendship
            and community.<br />
            <br />
            My mother on the other hand showed us the importance of creative
            expression, emotional expression, gratitude and kindness. She
            surrounded us with art, took us to the cinema, the theatre, the
            opera, and encouraged us to explore our creativity through painting,
            drawing, dancing, and theater classes. She also fostered emotional
            exploration and self-reflection by creating a safe place to share,
            be heard and understood. She taught us about kindness through acts
            of generosity such as volunteering and making sure we would do a
            number of GA (Good actions) per month. She also encouraged us to
            practice gratitude by being conscious of what we had. My mother’s
            values nurtured my sensitivity and the way I approach relationships
            and personal growth: I see the beauty in everything, I value
            emotional connection and kindness (and give back to the community
            through volunteering), and am deeply grateful for the life I have
            and people in it.

            <strong> Love of learning and curiosity:</strong><br />
            I really enjoy learning and discovering new things, and deepening my
            understanding of topics I am passionate about. My passion and
            curiosity keeps me going even when things get hard, and pushes me to
            exceed expectations by getting really deep into the understanding of
            a topic. <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Kindness and collaboration:</strong> <br />
            I think that working in a team makes working easier and more
            enjoyable. Working together allows people to fill each other's gaps
            and combine their strengths. When working as a team, we can look at
            challenges through different lenses and come up with solutions you
            wouldn’t come up with on your own. I really enjoy collaborating with
            passionate people who push me to be better. I love the proverb that
            “alone you can go faster , but together you can go further”.<br />
            <br />
            <strong> Perseverance and self-discipline:</strong><br />
            I don’t give up easily when things get hard. Instead I stay focused
            and work through obstacles one problem at a time. I’ve developed
            routines and habits which eliminate the need for motivation and
            discipline. I love planning in my notebooks, and calendar which
            allows me to stay on track and adapt when needed in order to achieve
            short and long term goals.

            Perfectionism: I often struggle to recognise when something is “good
            enough” and tend to push for perfection. This allowed me to improve
            in my career by producing high-quality work and aiming for
            continuous improvement, but it can also hold me back by making it
            difficult to efficiently complete tasks and be satisfied with the
            outcomes. But deadlines usually help with setting time limits.<br />
            <br />
            Humility: I tend to struggle with receiving negative feedback,
            especially if not expressed in a kind and constructive way. I really
            value kindness and communication, so when I perceive a feedback as
            being too harsh, I can quickly become discouraged or hurt. I am
            working on taking feedback less personally by focusing on what’s the
            problem that needs to be solved instead of the way it is being
            said.<br />
            <br />
            Self-doubt: I usually start doubting my worth and capabilities when
            criticised on my work outcomes. It often leads me to question my
            abilities to successfully complete what is being asked of me.

          <p>
            When I was studying at Victoria University, I had a group project to
            complete for a Video game development paper. We had to design and
            develop a video game. The team included a few design students (me
            included) and a few development students. The teams were formed
            based on votes for the games that were pitched in class. The project
            quickly became a nightmare due to a lack of communication and
            structure. <br />
            <br />
            We had no clear assigned roles, and no one respected the members who
            took the initiative to try to coordinate the project. This meant
            that tasks were often duplicated, progress was impossible to track,
            and milestones were missed. I quickly started to feel frustration
            when I tried to introduce weekly meetings to discuss the project and
            organise ourselves, but my messages were ignored and meetings were
            missed. I quickly gave up and focused on the things I could do to
            meet my course requirements.<br />
            <br />
            Looking back, I’ve learned the value of aligning on a goal, setting
            roles and communication early on in a project. If this situation
            were to repeat, I would set up a trello board to break down tasks,
            assign and track their progress, and set up recurring team catch-ups
            early on before the project gets momentum. <br />
