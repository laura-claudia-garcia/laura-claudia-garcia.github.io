            Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset
          </h1>
          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <h3>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
            people.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the brain’s capacity to form new neural pathways.
            Understanding this is important because it means that our
            intelligence and abilities aren’t fixed traits. When people learn
            about neuroplasticity, they realise that they can change their brain
            through challenge and repetition. This mindset helps to build
            resilience, motivation and a growth mindset.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
            for your benefit. What are some of the ways to increase your
            neuroplasticity?
          </h3>
          <p>
            One effective framework to build and maintain neuroplasticity is the
            AGES principle:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Attention:</strong> be fully present and focused on what
              you are learning. Avoid distractions by putting your phone away,
              and settle in a quiet environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generation:</strong> Actively associate new concepts with
              skills and principles you already know. Putting information into
              context helps see the connection between things and create
              stronger neural connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotions:</strong> Positive emotions strengthen learning.
              Attaching positive emotions such as excitement, curiosity or joy
              to new skills, the brain releases dopamine which reinforces neural
              pathways.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spacing:</strong> Regularly revisiting material over time
              helps build stronger and thicker neural pathways, while also
              moving the information from short term to long term memory.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Other ways to strengthen and maintain neuroplasticity</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep the brain agile:</strong> find activities that
              challenge you. Getting out of your comfort zone builds new neural
              pathways.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Move your body:</strong> Physical activity supports the
              creation of new neural pathways. Much of the brain is made to move
              (about 80% of our brain is for motor control), and movement helps
              regulate mood and stress which is crucial for plasticity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulate stress:</strong> Chronic stress and high levels
              of cortisol suppresses neuroplasticity to focus on survival bodily
              functions. So to protect your brain, aim to practice de-stressing
              activities such as mindfulness, relaxing activities, breathing
              exercises and stress coping strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eat a balanced diet:</strong> The brain uses 20% of the
              body’s energy. It is recommended to eat a nutrient-rich diet to
              support optimal brain function. This means eating lots of fruits,
              vegetables, whole grains and healthy fat (omega-3 fatty acids
              found in fish, nuts and seeds), while reducing processed food, red
              meat and processed sugars to prevent damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get good sleep:</strong> Your brain consolidates new
              memories, strengthens connections, and clears toxins during your
              sleep. Without enough rest, learning and memory formation will be
              impaired.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid alcohol:</strong> alcohol is known to wreck havoc
              into the neurons. It damages brain cells, disrupts neural
              communication and interferes with memory.
            </li>
          </ul>
