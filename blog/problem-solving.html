            Problem solving is the core skill for any good developer—languages
            and tools are only secondary to this fundamental skill, and it is
            often the hardest skill to learn for new developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few techniques that can help with the problem-solving
            process. These include understanding the problem, planning, writing
            pseudocode, subdividing, and rubber ducking.
          </p>

          <h2>Understand</h2>
          <p>
            The first step before attempting to solve any problem is to ensure
            you fully understand it. If you don’t understand a problem, it will
            be hard to know when you’ve successfully solved it, and you may
            waste a lot of time on the wrong solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fully understand a problem, try to reword it in plain English,
            draw diagrams to visualise it, and explain the problem to a peer or
            even an inanimate object.
          </p>

          <h2>Planning</h2>
          <p>
            Once you understand the problem, don’t jump into coding straight
            away—you first need to plan how you’re going to solve it. Here are
            some questions to help you plan:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like?
              What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on
              paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or
              will you get input from somewhere else?
            </li>
            <li>What’s the desired output?</li>
            <li>
              Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the
              desired output?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once you’ve answered the last question, you can start writing your
            solution as small steps in pseudocode.
          </p>

          <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
          <p>
            Pseudocode is writing the logic to get to the solution as small,
            digestible steps in plain English. It helps you think through the
            steps needed to reach the desired outcome.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example: Pseudocode for doing the laundry</strong></p>
          <pre><code>// put the laundry in the washing machine
// close the door
// add washing powder in the drawer
// press start
</code></pre>

          <h2>Subdividing</h2>
          <p>
            From planning to pseudocode, you’ve now divided your problem into
            subproblems. Each of the steps in your pseudocode is a subproblem.
            Pick the smallest and simplest one and start coding. Working this
            way makes complex problems easier to approach and understand. Your
            pseudocode might not include every necessary step, but solving
            subproblems will help you identify any missing pieces.
          </p>

          <h2>Rubber ducking</h2>
          <p>
            When you hit a roadblock and don’t have anyone to talk it through
            with, use the rubber ducky method. Rubber ducking involves
            explaining your coding problem in plain English to an inanimate
            object. This forces you to walk through your code, explain what you
            want it to do, and what isn’t working. Talk about the solutions
            you’ve tried and why they didn’t work, then imagine the questions
            someone else might ask. This technique helps you articulate the
            problem differently, step back, and change perspectives—often
            revealing the start of a solution.
          </p>
          <h2>My Experience with problem solving</h2>

          <h3>Blocked by a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            In a recent coding challenge, I had to create a piece of reusable
            code (called a function) that would return a specific result.
            Whatever I wrote in the function, the result wasn’t showing and the
            test was failing. I tried to re-explain the problem in plain english
            (pseudocode) and then attempted to write the function differently.
            But to my greatest frustration, the result was still not showing,
            and the test was still failing. I decided to explain the problem to
            my partner as well as the steps I took to solve it, but I still
            could not understand what was wrong. I then searched on google for
            solutions to similar problems, but it seemed like I was doing the
            right thing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since nothing I tried was working, I decided to ask an AI to point
            me towards the right direction. That’s when I realised that I had
            forgotten to add the word <strong>return</strong> for my function to
            return the answer. This day, I learnt that if a function doesn’t
            return anything, it could be because the word
            <strong>return</strong> is missing!
          </p>

          <h3>Solved a problem elegantly</h3>
          <p>
            In the same challenge, I had to write another function to solve a
            new problem: write a function (piece of reusable code) that takes a
            sentence, removes the word buzz from it, whether it is capitalized
            or not, it gives you that cleaned up sentence back. This problem
            seemed quite tricky. Instead of going straight on the tools, I took
            some time to analyse the problem to ensure I understood it, then did
            some pseudocode to break down the problem into small steps, and
            attempted to first solve the easy parts, ran the test and it passed.
            I was amazed and super proud that I had managed to solve the entire
            problem on my own even though at first it seemed quite difficult. It
            showed me the importance of respecting the process and breaking down
            difficult problems into tiny achievable steps.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem solving techniques confidence</h2>

          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
          <p>
            With the easier exercises, I didn;t quite see the point of pseudo
            code, but once we started the more difficult challenge, I realised
            that pseudocode could really help think through the steps needed to
            resolve an issue without getting too lost. It also helps to make a
            problem seem less daunting since the small steps should appear quite
            accessible. I am feeling somewhat confident in my ability to
            pseudocode. I will definitely get better at thinking through the
            steps needed once I get more practice and understand the
            possibilities.
          </p>

          <h3>Trying something</h3>
          <p>
            When we are first faced with a difficult problem, we may feel
            overwhelmed or a bit lost. Oftentimes, starting and just trying
            things will help guide us towards a working solution via trial and
            error, a lot of console log. Sometimes, a problem that seemed
            impossible looks a lot more manageable once we start working on it.
            I feel very confident in my ability to try something as I am a very
            curious and persisting person.
          </p>

          <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
          <p>
            When getting stuck, explaining the problem and the solutions that
            were tried and why they failed helps to guide us towards the right
            path. When I get stuck, I mostly follow this process with my partner
            which has helped me tremendously already. I am somewhat confident in
            this ability, but I need to practice the way I explain a problem and
            what was attempted without letting my frustration takeover.
          </p>

          <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          <p>
            When stuck reading errors can point us in the direction of what we
            need to fix/work on. I am very confident in my ability to check for
            errors in the console.
          </p>

          <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          <p>
            Console logging is the ability to pass something to write into the
            console. It can be extremely useful to check the result of something
            or to see if something exists. When getting stuck, console logging
            can help understand what we got wrong/what isn’t working. I am very
            confident in my ability to do so.
          </p>

          <h3>Googling</h3>
          <p>
            When different problem solving techniques haven’t worked or when you
            don’t quite know how to do something, googling the problem or the
            fact can be a life saver. Specificity is important, so using
            keywords such as the coding language is key for finding the right
            answer. I am very confident in my ability to google things when I
            need more information or help getting unstuck.
          </p>

          <h3>Asking your peers or coaches for help</h3>
          <p>
            When you’re feeling stuck and a quick google hasn't helped, asking
            other people for help can be a time saver, instead of spending hours
            going in circles and getting more and more frustrated. Sometimes,
            the ego or shyness can get in the way, but asking for help isn’t a
            sign of vulnerability, it is simply saying “Hey I don’t know this,
            do you? Could we figure it out together?”. I am very confident in my
            ability to ask for help when needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          <p>
            After each new challenge, it can be extremely helpful to pause and
            reflect in order to keep progressing. Some questions you can ask
            yourself are “what went well?”, “Why did it go well?”, “What do I
            need to keep doing?”, “What went wrong?”, “Why did it go wrong?”,
            “What do I need to stop doing?”. I am quite confident in my ability
            to learn from experiences, but I need to take more time to actually
            pause and reflect.
          </p>

          <h2>Asking for help</h2>
          <p>
            I have never really been reluctant to ask for help in an environment
            that felt safe to do so. The only times I haven;t felt safe asking
            for help was when I had previously felt judged, rejected or talked
            down on for not knowing something or understanding something.
            Otherwise, I usually ask for help when I feel stuck for a certain
            amount of time before the frustration becomes too high.
